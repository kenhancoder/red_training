# Red Community

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/red/community](https://badges.gitter.im/red/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/red/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is a resource for Red users and members of the community. Generally that
means software developers of some kind, so you'll find information targeted
mainly at that audience. But Red can be used by anybody, for many different
purposes. You don't need to be a professional developer to use the resources
here.

As a resource repository for Red developers, you'll find scripts, tools, demos,
documentation, tutorials, and more, all contributed by members of the Red
community. It's more open than the official Red and Red Code repositories, where
people can post demos of things they've written in Red, as well as reusable
functions, libraries, and tools for others to use.

All over the world that are major initiatives to get more and younger children actively programming. Red's virtues of small size, syntax that encourages understandable code and its built-in GUI will undoubtedly attract children. Please bear this in mind when submitting any contributions or chatting about them.

# Organisation

Currently the repository has the folowing directories:

    apps
    demos
    dialects
    games
    how-to
    mezz
    parse
    red-system
    tools
    

# Submitting Scripts and Code

A separate Github Pull Request should be made for each script that you wish to submit.

It would be good if your code followed the [Red coding style guide](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Coding-Style-Guide) but it is not mandatory.

Including a [Red Community Code Header](https://github.com/red/community/wiki/Community-Code-Headers) will help others find, understand and use your code.
